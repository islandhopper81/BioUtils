Revision history for BioUtils

1.0.11	Under development
	- added object for reformatting Genbank to GFF3 files
	- added file option to input a fasta on reverse_complement.pl
	- fastq option for filter_contaminants.pl
	- Removed cat command from parallel contaminant filtering to improve
	  memory efficiency.
	- Added some bsub parameter options to filter_contaminants
	- Added command line options to filter_contaminants
	- Fixed naming convention bug in QC::ContaminantFilter.pm
	- Added script for easy quality to int investigation (quals_to_ints.pl)

1.0.9	Mon June 2, 2014
	- Added Muscle option for building an MSA in ConsensusBuilder
	- Added an algorithm for building a consensus from non-square alignment
	  matrix
	- Added trimming option to FastqFilter prior to filtering algorithm
	- Small bug fixes

1.0.8	Thurs Jan 16, 2014
    - Added LSF Parallel options for contaminant removal via blast
	- Added libraries for Alignment operations including
		- Needleman-Wunsch
		- Smith-Waterman
		- Ojects the hold aligned sequences
	- Added an entropy calculator based on Shannon entropy
	- Added trimming methods to Fast*Seq objects
	- New Consnesus Building methods (untested)

1.0.7	Sat Aug 24, 2013
    - Added dependancy build to Build.PL
	- Added Fastq Filter options for c_scores	
	- Added module for IUPAC to nucleotide conversion
	- Added c_score attribute to FastqConsensus which grades the similarity
	  of the sequences used to build the MSA

1.0.6	Mon Jul 29, 2013
	- Fixed a memory bug in the consensus building algorithm.  Previously,
	  large numbers of consensus building calls required >20G of memory.
	  Now comparable samples can be run in < 1G of memory.

1.0.5  	Tues Jul 23, 2013
	- Added set_header method in FastqSeq.pm
	- Bug fixes in FastqSeq.t

1.0.4  Fri Jun 14, 2013
       - Changed fastq filter output file name conventions.  Previously they
         were named filtered and unfiltered.  They are now HQ (high quality)
	 and LQ (low quality).

1.0.2  Wed May 29, 2013
       - Added paired fastq file filtering capabilities

1.0.1  Fri Apr 19, 2013
       - Changed consensus algorithm such that gaps are not included in consensus

1.0.0  Fri Apr 8, 2013
       Initial complete release.
